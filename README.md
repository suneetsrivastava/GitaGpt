## How it works

This project uses the [OpenAI GPT-3 API](https://openai.com/api/) (specifically, text-davinci-003) and [Vercel Edge functions](https://vercel.com/features/edge-functions) with streaming. It constructs a prompt based on the form and user input, sends it to the GPT-3 API via a Vercel Edge function, then streams the response back to the application.
